        "Utilized web scraping solutions to gather data from diverse sources using Python and web scraping frameworks such as beautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium (for JavaScript-heavy websites). <br />\
        Developed a comprehensive dataset for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, which was successfully added to the Hugging Face Model Hub. <br />\
        Collaborated with a team of NLP experts affiliated with Vector Institute to define annotation guidelines for the dataset, ensuring high-quality annotations and facilitating  unsupervised learning tasks. \
        Extensively worked with a wide range of NLP models, from traditional approaches like Word2Vec and GloVe to state-of-the-art models such as BERT and GPT-4. \
        Performed prompt engineering: conducted in-depth research and analysis of prompts for LLMs such as GPT-4 and LLaMa, understanding the impact of prompting on model behaviour and output quality. \
        Applied unsupervised learning techniques to the dataset, including constrained clustering, to group the wall clues into meaningful clusters based on contextual embeddings. \

        "Curated and collected a large-scale dataset of TTS speech samples covering a wide range of accents, dialects, and speaking rates, ensuring representation of various linguistic characteristics. \
        Developed fine-tuning pipelines and strategies to adapt pre-trained ASR models to the specific attributes of TTS speech data, addressing challenges such as accent variations, speaking rate differences, and dysarthric disorders. \
        conducted extensive data processing, including utilization of Dynamic Time Warping for temporal segmentation of speech samples. \
        Conducted thorough evaluations and benchmarking of the fine-tuned ASR models, comparing their performance with the baseline models on standard evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and accuracy. \
        Collaborated with domain experts and linguists to validate the improvements achieved by proposed models, ensuring the enhanced models accurately captured dysarthric speech. \
        Implemented MLOps practices by developing a web application that analyzes dysarthric speech and performs automatic temporal segmentation. The web app was developed using Docker and Kubernetes to ensure efficient deployment and scalability of machine learning models. \
